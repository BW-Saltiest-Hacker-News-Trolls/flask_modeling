      "A leaky head gasket will usually produce a white smoke that smells a bit like pot smoke. That's the ethylene glycol in the antifreez/coolant being burnt. The new anti-bleach craze is laughable. I had one woman at the local dog beach tell me \"You know bleach is the same chlorine they use in swimming pools and we know that stuff causes cancer.\" I spend at least an hour a day swimming laps. Have done so since I was eight. And I at one point lived in a country where we regularly added small amounts of bleach to drinking water to disinfect it. If chlorine causes cancer I am doomed. \n",

      "Lots of contradictions in this short screed. Apparently fining people for putting their trash in the recycling is bad, but charging them for landfill waste is good. What will stop these people from trying to save money by putting it in the recycling instead? Fines perhaps? Landfills are good because they give off methane, but recycling food and yard waste is bad. Yet isn't it exactly those parts of the waste stream that decompose to methane and can be captured directly? Recycling trucks use too much fuel but locating landfills out in the country is sensible. The recycling industry is just make work for special interests, yet we should stop recycling paper so that we can keep tree loggers in jobs. \n",

      "> No it isn't, it's basically suicidal. We wouldn't evolve to be mostly altruistic if being altruistic was bad for our survival. Evolving concerns the species (and its survival) not the individual and its survival. It literally has nothing to do with your individual survival (except depending on you surviving long enough to make offspring). Heck, awful as it is, if you raped 2000 women and gave progeny to 2000 kids it would be considered great from an evolutionary aspect -- far more than \"being altruistic\". \n",

      "This story talks about London Black cabs, but the consultation is about private hire taxis. So the article is comparing disimilar things. Uber's problems with the existing private hire regulations are the need for an agreed price before travel. The proposed minimum wait time feels stupid. I'd be interested to see how that's justified. The requirement for a fixed landline probably has some weak justification, but it feels like something that's rapidly approaching obsolesance. I'm normally pretty anti-Uber, but the proposals in the article don't seem to focus on my priorities. (Which would be to stop taxi drivers from discriminating against people with disabilities). \n",

      "One idea: On crash, the module could lock down to broadcasting a timestamped accident warning (no replay attacks) and would need someone with authorized access to reset it. Doesn't really solve a hacker getting a non-crashed-but-otherwise-junked vehicle though :) Edit: There's no reason to assume a hacker won't get access to the kit to reset a module as well.

      "Uh, yeah....firms that specialize in security have a hard time getting all the kinks out. There's no way I would ever trust an app made by journalists to protect other journalists' security, especially if it were closed-source. This doesn't have anything to do with the stereotype of journalists not being computer programmers. It's the notion that a journalists' operational security \"just needs an app\"...or even, that journalists need their own special app -- even though most of the features described in Reporta would be useful to just about anyone. And by targeting mainly journalists, you have a much, much smaller user base to test it and give feedback on. The most successful app-by-journalists-for-journalists is probably Django, but that became big by not tying itself to newsroom conventions. edit: It's hard to think of anything \"designed specifically for a journalist\" that is best-in-class. This includes note-taking and photography apps. \n",

      "What if someone could do any of those things intentionally and maliciously, instead of merely by accident? If the vehicle is an ambulance, a well-intentioned intruder could break it at any time, whereas a malicious one could break it at the worst possible time. While either one could cause a disaster while carrying a trauma patient at full speed on the highway, the accidental damage might also occur while motionless and empty in a parking lot. If grey-hats can patch a vulnerability against your will, it is very likely that they first tried disclosing the vulnerability to the manufacturer of your device, and they declined to fix it within a reasonable time, or you didn't run that update. Either way, whatever damage done to the device as a result of exploiting vulnerability would not have occurred if the vulnerability had already been repaired. \n",

      "Amusingly, after months of pointless bikeshedding, we managed to convince the internals team to throw an exception during the extreme case of a CSPRNG failure. https://www.sammyk.me/security-changes-to-the-php-7-csprng-i... You can read my arguments on the mailing list, but basically it amounted to: $chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567'; for ($i = 0; $i < 12; ++$i) { $password .= $chars[random_int(0, 31)]; } If random_int() returned FALSE, $password would be the string 'aaaaaaaaaaaa' (and you'd have 12 E_WARNING errors in your log). By making it an exception, random_int() will now fail closed (kill the script by default), but the developer can still handle it gracefully. $chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567'; try { for ($i = 0; $i < 12; ++$i) { $password .= $chars[random_int(0, 31)]; } } catch (Throwable $e) { $framework->template->kill('An unrecoverable fatal error occurred.'); } Or something similar.

We might have to write something though that asks for a username and password, but whoa... OSX makes that surprisingly easy...

      "The reluctance of the Federal Reserve to lend to Lehman contrasts with its actions regarding Bear Stearns and A.I.G. The difference is that in the other two cases, the Fed saw itself as lending against reasonable collateral. See my comment below for further explanation. Of course, at the end of the day it's all somewhat arbitrary - the Fed was just placing (decently-educated) bets on risk-laden firms: \"Hmmm...this bank is probably too important for us to let it fail, this one might pay us back if we pump money into it, this one looks rotten, if we let this one fail now it might trigger a death spiral...\" \n",
