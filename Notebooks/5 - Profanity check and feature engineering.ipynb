      "commenting on this quote from the article: \"‘I’m 29. This is what you do when you’re 29\" I don't know what the fuck is it with this wall street culture. I find SV culture banal and disgusting but no where close to the shit show that is the wall street glamorized by movies and tv shows. I would've done the same and I have done the same when I was 25. Working like crazy. You realize one day, this is bullshit. Everyone in this shitty place is fucking bullshit. A check at the end of the fucking month that translates into a measely minimum wage if you count the long hours and the office male bravado bullshit. High school never ends. It's only after I was chewed and spit out, I realized, no amount of glamor or prestige is worth chasing if there's no chance at MY happiness and MY health. This make it till you are 30 mentality bullshit has got to go. The anxiety it gives a person in early to mid 20s to feel like you need to keep moving to feel like you are moving closer to success. Lot of young men like ourselves are conditioned to believe that giving up a decade of our youth to live like kings and gods the rest of our lives is a pretty seductive thought, no matter how unlikely the chances, society almost expects young men to behave and perform like robots, showing no emotion, just take it and bring home the bacon. These days, I'm a bit older and beginning to think, good things, like all other things, take time. This kamikaze rags to riches type of mentality we see in movies, doesn't seem to work very well (you burn out quickly). This quote from Frank Lopez in Scarface rings true here. \"Hey, Tony. Remember when I told you when you first started working for me, the guys that last in this business, are the guys who fly straight. Low-key, quiet. But the guys who want it all, chicas, champagne, flash... they don't last. \" Don't think I want to be part of any work culture where shitty cocaine mixed in some shithole in colombia and commiting adultery with overpriced hookers with plastic boobs . \n",

      "The core problem with reddit is there's no firewall between communities. So the fact that there are communities specifically set up with the goal of hating blacks or fat people or women or what-have-you means that those people spend a lot of time on reddit and end up spilling over into other popular communities. The moderation tools and admin support on reddit are comparatively underpowered so for a lot of popular sub-reddits it's very easy for the overall quality to plummet when a tiny group of vocal assholes decides they want to squat there. And for most sub-reddits this just starts a spiral of death as good people decide not to waste their time wading through toxic garbage and just find somewhere else to be, while the toxic minority gets stronger and more brazen. Imagine you have several subscriptions to a bunch of different print magazines. Every couple days a new magazine shows up. Stuff like Scientific American, The Economist, Better Homes and Gardens, National Geographic, TV Guide, Rolling Stone, Cat Fancy, etc. All fine and good. Except sometimes, maybe once every quarter per magazine, maybe less often even, there's some really weird stuff in your magazines. There's a 10 page article praising the KKK in your copy of Rolling Stone. Or there's a thing about how the jews did 9/11. Or the ads in Cat Fancy are all relentlessly making fun of fat people. Or there's an insert in the October edition of Scientific American that's actually a personal letter to you that is filled with hate and vitriol and ends with a plea for you to commit suicide. Who would put up with that? They wouldn't. But that's what people have been asked to deal with on sites like reddit, and it's beyond a reasonable level. How much shit is acceptable in your drinking water? Just a tiny bit? How about just 1 hour a year where the tap pours out 50/50 shit & water? Is that acceptable? No, it's not. There's far too much shit in the drinking water at reddit, the fact that the drinking water is not, in fact, mostly shit is not a defense. \n",

      "Fwiw: I paid accident claims for over five years. Most claims fell into one of two categories: \"accident waiting to happen\" or people trying to get coverage for things like the chiropractic care they were going to get three times a week anyway. Only a tiny portion of claims really struck me as shit happens/man, it sucks to be you. If you really want low health bills: Do all that boring stuff you constantly read about, like brush, floss, eat right, exercise, and only drink in moderation. Do not ever get rip roaring drunk. Especially do not drive or engage in other dangerous activities while drunk or high. Don't sleep around casually. Don't ride a motor cycle. If you want to go hiking in the mountains, take the appropriate precautions and do not drink or do drugs. A lot of claims will not be covered anyway if you were drinking, taking drugs or engaging in risky behavior (parachuting, mountain climbing). And keep in mind that insurance only protects against financial loss, and only to a limited degree. If you permanently maim yourself doing stupid crap, you will not only be stuck with high medical bills and reduced odds of making a good income thereafter, you are also permanently maimed, duh. Living with chronic pain and other issues of that ilk still sucks majorly, even if you win the lottery and are set for life financially. /boring old fogey \n",

Being \"set in your ways\" is not endearing, and certainly not acceptable. \"It was a different time\" is bullshit. No, it wasn't. There is no demarcation line between now and then. There weren't any different issues, everyone had the same problems. We are all products of the same past. Time is continuous. Playing this game of \"you get a pass because you're gonna die soon anyway\" is infecting future generations with the idea that we can tolerate intolerance if the intolerant person is particularly stubborn enough. Barring straight up senility, the persons your elders are now we're the people they've always been. If they don't get technology today, it's because they have always been unable to easily learn new things. If they say racist shit today, it's because they lived through the civil rights movement of the 60s-- as well as all of the other movements we've gotten to live through ourselves--and said \"yep, that's not for me\". If they act like your opinion can't possibly be right or important, it is because they were always a sociopath. Age doesn't make you an asshole. If anything, I've seen it mellow people out.

If you want to argue this security is worth it, that's a different argument. I suspect most people who just want to get shit done are going to find it a huge pain in the ass. You can also argue these people are stupid. As for standards, vendors follow FHS and friends exactly as far as it helps them justify whatever they want to do. If you really want to argue from the perspective that \"this is standard and that's the reason it's done\", that seems awfully silly to me given the layout and other permissions of apple systems. It's pretty non-FHS/etc to have /Applications be writable, for example.

To go off on a bit of a tangent: Don't get me wrong, I know the power words have since I was bullied for several years. I also understand how much of a struggle weight loss can be. But part of the reason that those words are so powerfully negative for a fat person is because of the shame they already feel for being obese, unhealthy and having no self control.
